## TODO:

- API:
  - pods:
    - three types of management: delegation, home, and query
    - should be able to delegate with restrictions so that the
      pods can only post certain content on their behalf
    - query pods should be malleable.
  - local changes for list

- Optimization
  - Cache results of similar queries

- Testing/Validation
  - test file for header encoders
  - more tests for local changes in index
  - validate return type of query/list results
